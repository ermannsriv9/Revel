What is API Key
An *API key* is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests made to an API (Application Programming Interface). It's like a password or token that grants access to a particular service or resource. Here's a breakdown of its uses:
### Key Uses of an API Key:
1. *Authentication and Authorization*:- The API key ensures that the user making the request has the necessary permissions to access the service. It helps authenticate the client or user making requests to the API, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the service.
 2. *Access Control*:- By using API keys, API providers can control who has access to the resources, manage usage limits, and monitor activity. It helps service providers restrict or allow access to specific users, based on the key associated with the request.
How to Generate API Keys for BigQuery & Gemini in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 
To generate an API key for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services like BigQuery and Gemini, follow these steps:
Step 1. *Sign in to Google Cloud Console*
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Log in with your Google account.
Step 2. *Create a Project (if you don't have one)*
   - In the Cloud Console, click the *project drop-down* on the top-left side of the page.
   - Select *New Project*.
   - Name your project and click *Create*.
Step 3. *Enable the Required APIs*
   - Navigate to the *API & Services > Library* section.
   - Search for *BigQuery API* and *Gemini API*.
   - Click on the APIs and then enable them for your project.
Step 4. *Create an API Key*
   - In the *API & Services > Credentials* section, click *Create Credentials*.
   - Select *API Key*.
   - Your new API key will appear. You can copy it and use it to authenticate requests to BigQuery or Gemini.
Step 5. *Restrict the API Key (optional but recommended)*
   - Click *Restrict Key* after creating the API key.
   - Choose the restrictions based on your use case, such as restricting it to specific IP addresses, or specific APIs like BigQuery.
Step 6. *Save Your API Key*
   - Keep your API key secure and do not expose it in public code repositories. You may want to store it in a secure environment variable or a secrets management tool.

## Create an account if you don't have one ##
Step 4: Generate GitHub Token (Classic)
Go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic).
Click Generate new token.
Select scopes like repo, workflow, read:org, etc.
Copy the token and store it securely (you wonâ€™t be able to see it again).
Step 5: Clone a GitHub Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ermannsriv9/Revil.git
cd Revil
Step 6: Check Git Status
bash
Copy
Edit
git status
Step 7: Initialize & Push Project to GitHub
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "# Revel" >> README.md     # Add README file
git init                        # Initialize local repo
git add README.md               # Stage file
git commit -m "first commit"    # Commit
git branch -M main              # Rename default branch to main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ermannsriv9/Revel.git  # Add remote
git push -u origin main         # Push to remote
 Step 8: Sync Branch & Add Files
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main            # Pull latest changes
git checkout main               # Switch to main branch
Add or update your documentation (e.g. in README.md), then:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add filename                # Stage changes
git commit -m "document for API key and Git setup"  # Commit changes
git push origin main            # Push to GitHub
